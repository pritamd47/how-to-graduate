# How to: Master's Thesis Defense

## Your committee:

Decide (with your advisor) who will be your second committee member (your committee consists of your advisor plus one more faculty member for your MS thesis defense), and reach out to them to make sure they can serve on your committee. You may already have a rough idea for when you plan on defending your thesis (at least an idea of which academic quarter), it is good to make sure that your committee members will be available and not too busy or away that quarter.

## Planning the thesis defense

* **Schedule your thesis defense date _at least 2 months in advance_.** Coordinate with your committee members on a date/time that works for them. Reserve a room on campus to have your thesis defense presentation in. (See notes at the end of the page about reserving a meeting room for exams/presentations)

* **Send a clean draft of your thesis to your committee members _at least 2 weeks prior to your defense_.** They will discuss comments with you during the second half of the defense.

* **Submit a degree request through MyGrad**
  * Log in to [MyGrad](https://grad.uw.edu/for-students-and-post-docs/mygrad-program/) and go to *Request Degree* > *Master*
  * Select "MASTER OF SCIENCE IN CIVIL ENGINEERING - Civil Engineering, Major/Pathway: CIV E 0"

* **Get your _[Master's Supervisory Committee Approval Form](https://www.grad.washington.edu/wp-content/uploads/thesis-approval-form.pdf)_ and print it out. Bring it with you to your thesis defense.** Your committee will need to sign it once you've passed your defense!

## Submitting your "Electronic Thesis/Dissertation"
- [Thesis formatting guidelines](https://www.grad.washington.edu/for-students-and-post-docs/thesisdissertation/etd-formatting-guidelines/)
  - Alternatively, [use my formatted thesis word document as a template](docs/my_thesis.docx)
- [This "ProQuest ETD Administrator" website](https://www.etdadmin.com/main/home?siteId=412) is where you upload your thesis document (it requires that you make an account, different than your UWNetID ?)
- What copywrite option do I choose?
  - Pick one that you don't have to pay for. I chose the "Creative Commons License, Attribution (CC BY)"

[Make sure that you get your **pay raise** the following quarter.](https://grad.uw.edu/graduate-student-funding/funding-information-for-departments/administering-assistantships/ta-ra-salaries/)
