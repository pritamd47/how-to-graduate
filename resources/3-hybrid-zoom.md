# In Person / Online Presentations

##  Tips for giving a hybrid in person / online Zoom presentation

- **Zoom Link**: Have your adviser create the Zoom Link so that there is an unlimited time limit to the meeting and a chat. 
- **Zoom Hosts**: Have a trusted friend (or two) registered as Zoom hosts. You (the presenter) **do not** want to be signed in as a Zoom host. This prevents a window popping up during your presentation, telling you to admit people into the meeting. Leave that work to your trusted friend(s) while you present. 
- Don't forget to have your trusted friend(s) assign you as the Zoom host *once you are done* presenting. This way, you have all access to the Zoom link if a committee member is online after the presentation is over. 
- **Sharing Your Screen**: To avoid the green frame around your powerpoint while presenting, try sharing a *window* of your computer, then moving the powerpoint presentation *into* that window (rather than sharing the powerpoint screen directly).  
- **Using a Clicker**: If you're using a fancy hand-held clicker to advance your slides, keep in mind it only works on the computer's *active* window. If your clicks appears to not be working, try clicking on your presention (with your computer mouse) to make sure it's the *active* window--then the hand-held clicker should be able to advance the slides.
