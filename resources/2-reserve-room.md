# Reserving a meeting room for exams/presentations

This question comes up a lot, here are some suggestions and resources for reserving a meeting room for your exams/presentations.
- **More Hall**: Contact or visit the [CEE front office](https://www.ce.washington.edu/about/contact) to ask about reserving a room in More Hall.
- **ECE 303** is in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering building](https://www.washington.edu/maps/#!/ece). See the room calendar [here](https://peden.ece.uw.edu/calendars/ece-303/), and [reserve here](https://vannevar.ece.uw.edu/cgi-bin/operations/calendars/calendar_reservation_request.pl?asset=ECE_303&gcalid=uw.edu_725f6565312d333033%40resource.calendar.google.com). As of 2023, this room has a projector and a podium.
- **ECE 403** upstairs from ECE 303. See the room calendar [here](https://peden.ece.uw.edu/calendars/ece-403/), and [reserve here](https://vannevar.ece.uw.edu/cgi-bin/operations/calendars/calendar_reservation_request.pl?asset=ECE_403&gcalid=uw.edu_725f6565312d343033%40resource.calendar.google.com).
- **UW Libraries meeting spaces**: The smaller study rooms with whiteboards are perfect for a qualifying exam with your committee, the larger meeting rooms are better for presentations. [See information and make reservations here](https://www.lib.washington.edu/services/spaces).
- **Research Commons**: In the Allen Library South, the Research Commons has a [varity of spaces to reserve](https://www.lib.washington.edu/commons/Workspaces).
- This is a general [room request form](https://eventservices.uw.edu/room-request/) from UW event services (though I haven't heard of anyone using this for reserving a space for their exams).
- [Spaces at the HUB can be reserved](https://hub.washington.edu/reserve/book-a-space/how-to-reserve/), though it looks like this will have to be done by someone in the CEE front office for you.
- **Molecular Engineering & Sciences Building (MoIES 115)** has a 49 seat capicity conference room which can be [reserved online](https://www.collaborationcore.uw.edu/building/meeting-rooms/meeting-room-scheduling-request/). The room availibility is also [publicly available](https://outlook.office365.com/calendar/published/R_RM.MolES.0001@uw.edu/Calendar/calendar.html). Note that the room is at the corner of the building, so signs with arrows indicating the path to the room from the front entrance are helpful. Should be beautiful on a sunny day with large windows :)
